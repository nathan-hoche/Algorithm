# About this Project
This project is a list of all the algorithm I saw/use. I wanted to let anyone know how to easily implement an algorithm in a lot of different case. The objectif of this project is to have an easy way to see the difference between all algorithm.

# How to test an algorithm:

1. Go inside the folder you want
2. Execute the following line:
```sh
python3 tester.py [algorithm] [TestingFile]
# algorithm name can be find in 'algo' folder
# TestingFile can be find in json/map folder /!\ Need to precise the type: test.json / test.txt
```
3. Be happy!!! :)

## You search an algorithm which is not in this list?
In this case don't hesitate to add an issues! I tried to add a lot of different algorithm but I don't know all algorithms. I will try to add your algorithm in less than 2 weeks! ;)
